-- Project --

This project is create using TDD. The source code and the tests are
in separate folder named src and tests.

-- Setters in src.ContactManagerImpl --

Setters in ContactMangagerImpl are created for the purpose of tests gaining access and setting variables in the
class. They should be removed in the real implementation of the class for encapsulation reasons. 
I couldnâ€™t find a way around having them, as the tests
need access to setting variables.
